<h1>CART 351 FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1>
<h1 class="title">"Social Networks - A Small Universe"</h1>
<h2> by Yasmine Roy and Cathering Weng </h2>

<h2 class="sectionTitle"> Questions </h2>
<h3>What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others? Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space?</h3>
  <p>
    The Internet is a social space, where interactions between users are the basis of all environments. Social media websites are merely just spaces with data flowing constantly, being transmitted from user to user. The users provide data, and the developer utilizes it to further expand their media platforms. In focusing on this social aspect, we want to focus on visually representing a network, where each user is given a circle-shaped node that they manipulate based on their activity (for example, tracking user activity and tracking profile visits within a certain time frame). The visual representation would be simple and minimalistic, leaving the emphasis on the user’s activity and interaction. By doing so, the nodes become connected, allowing the user to see the connections people make with each other through a network. Since we are users and developers, familiar with both social media and programming, we have the means to look at our activity and interactions from another point of view. This project holds importance for us because it is a relatively small scale; as developers, we can include only people important to us. Thus, we can see  connections form between family and friends. To others, using our network can facilitate seeing the connections their acquaintances make. This topic can help reveal to us different perspectives of the networked-based spaces we use everyday, exploring them from a developer and user’s point of view.
  </p>

  <h3>Think about the kind of relationship you wish to encourage between your users and this “space”. How can you use this “space” to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society?</h3>
<p>
  Data is typically disassociated from the user, as the user is a living being with thoughts and emotions, while the data is merely information being transmitted. However, we want to show that without the user, there is no data, therefore emphasizing the connection between the two. In addition, a network is a series of connections between nodes, each representing a user with their own data. Users in this space will be able to see the strength of their connections with others, allowing them to discover things about the people in their immediate social circles. They could learn about the interactions between their friends and family, for example, discovering that mutual friends know each other, or the interaction frequency between certain people. This can cause them to reflect on their own place among the relationships in this network, to the point of developing an attachment to the space, and contributing more data to it. Of course, the space will start off small, as it is limited to the few users who decide to use it. As developers, we want to encourage the users to actually “use” the space and interact with it. The more activity and interaction, the stronger the connections and nodes will become within the network.
</p>

<h3>Think about the notion of empowerment. Will your “space” help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration, understanding between user(s)? How and Why?</h3>
<p>
  In exploring various ways of visually representing networks, we can create a space where the user sees the effects of their interactions and activity. They notice the impacts they have not only on other users, but on themselves as well. Regular social media is tailored to the user- a feed showing only posts from friends, targeted advertisements, conversations only with people you are close with. People’s vision are limited simply to the people they interact with, never encouraged to explore other perspectives or points of view. It is ironic considering that the Internet is a free space with unlimited information, yet no one tries to explore things that are unknown to them. With our project, however, we force the user to look at the entire network from an objective view, where all connections are seen and interactable. If the connections between people are displayed in this way, they will be able to explore outside of their own immediate online world. If they wish, they can have a deeper understanding of social circles and interactions outside of their own. People are the ones manipulating their own nodes and connections, so they can also make their space appear as they please. For example, they can make themselves look more popular by visiting many pages frequently and therefore creating many connections. For us, it gives us an interesting outlook as to how social interactions function online, and how we can tailor to them as developers. We will be able to truly see if a social space can be a source of power for the user, for the developer, or both.

<p>This map created by Eric Fischer was inspired by <a class="textLink" href="http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?chicagodots" target=blank>Bill Rankin's map of Chicago's racial and ethnic divides</a>. Data is taken from the census of a certain region and plotted out as dots on a map. Red represents whites, Blue as Blacks, Green as Asians, Orange as Hispanics and Grey for others. Each dot represents 25 people. This map reveals an interesting trend of racial divide between neighborhoods and offers some insight into the city’s diversity. We chose this project for the neat, clean, visually appealing presentation laid out on a 2D plane and how easy it is to interpret the information displayed. We want to use the work as a source of inspiration for the aesthetic presentation of our project, even though both projects may use different kinds of mediums.

<a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2014/10/27/the-reddit-world-map/" target=blank>Randal Olson Reddit World Map</a>
<p>Randal Olson is a dual PhD graduate in Computer Science & Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behaviour. He used Gephi to create an interactive map of Reddit and the associations between each subreddit. Described in his <a class="textLink" href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-4/" target=blank>article</a>, his goal was to group similar topics together, since social media sites like Reddit are massive and difficult to navigate, leaving the user to rely on word of mouth or search engines to web surf. These discoveries can help organize users into smaller groups based around mutual interests, which Olson claims is essential to the survivability of social media by making this vast network feel small and navigable. Users can search within their current narrow range of interests or zoom out to a broader classification, e.g. moving from a specific band, to rock music, to music in general.  His map is organized by size, colour, and placement, denoting the activity level with size, number of connections with color and placement by how much shared user activity the subreddits had. He also reorganized the map to divide interests by colour, revealing the clusters of smaller communities within Reddit. He also took this map and analyzed the network to discover it has a small-world, modular community structure. This data projection is very similar to how we want ours to look- Nodes grouped based on who and how they interact with each other, customized according to factors such as activity. We can analyze the structure in ours to find associations between friend groups and such.

<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3068474/the-real-difference-between-google-and-apple" target=blank>The Difference in Innovation Between Google and Apple</a>
<p>Shown in this example of a node-based diagram is the difference in innovation methods between Google and Apple. The Google diagram nodes are more numerous by far, and all of a relatively uniform size. The apple nodes are fewer, with a select few exponentially larger than all the others. Each node represents a patent inventor, showing how each company operates in coming out with new innovative features. Apple’s diagram implied a top-down, centrally-controlled structure led by a few individuals. Google’s indicates a flatter hierarchical structure with more small independent groups and opportunities. While the density makes it difficult to interpret, this node diagram in particular is very visually appealing. The plethora of connections and nodes are reminiscent of neural pathways, fading out at the edges in an almost ethereal manner. This also serves as inspiration into how we want our project to be presented, creating a network that can be educational, but beautiful at the same time.

<h2 class="sectionTitle"> Conclusion </h2>
<h3>Write a paragraph on how/why your project will be different and more interesting in comparison to the projects you researched.</h3>
<p>Our project will be on a smaller scale, since we are working with people who are close to us personally. Therefore, there will be no issues in trying to interpret the network visually: we will focus on employing simple aesthetic elements that will be attractive to the user. In the end, our main focus is on increasing activity, in order to create the best version of our space that we can. In addition to this, we want to add an interactable visual aesthetic, using simple animations and shifting color schemes. In comparison to the projects we chose, ours will emulate movement, which will contrast with the still images used for the node-linked diagrams. In the end, our hopes it to make our project interesting enough to capture the attention of the user, and make them think about themselves not only from a user’s perspective, but from a data perspective, to widen their scopes.
